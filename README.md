# E-Prime_Templates: Masked Self-Paced Reading Task

This is a template for a masked "moving window" style self-paced reading (SPR) experiment in E-Prime 3.0.

In the experiment, a prime is shown, followed by a sentence. The participant can only see one word of the sentence at a time.
At their own pace, the participant may press any button on the keyboard to progress to the next word.
When the sentence ends, a question will be presented to the participant.

This experiment includes inline scripts to automatically mask sentences which the experimenter can specify as an attribute within the SPRList e-object.

This experiment template was built by Dylan Scott Low with support from the Department of English Language, Literature and Linguistics at Providence University, Taiwan.
