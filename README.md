# E-Prime_Templates: Lexical Priming
This is an experiment template based on an experiment designed by Justin F. Gerle, a Carnegie Mellon University student whose work was released as a student submission under STEP (System for Teaching Experimental Psychology). Gerle's original design can be downloaded from the official PST website at https://support.pstnet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047800273-STEP-Bi-directional-Priming-34544-, where it is hosted with the permission of Brian MacWhinney.

The current experiment was created as a refinement of Gerle's design.

There are two trial blocks: a set of practice trials followed by the acutal trials. The experiment aims to investigate the priming effect within pairs of words, with one word presented after the other in a sequential manner. The vocabulary words used as the priming stimuli describe different foods (some words were changed from Gerle's original set to be less culturally American-centric). The target stimuli encompass four classes: collocate food (e.g. "cookies" after "milk"), non-collocate food (e.g. "pizza" after "milk"), food-like non-word (e.g. "caokies" after "milk"), and non-food (e.g. "wall" after "milk").

Note: An important change from Gerle's design is that participants respond to Stimulus2 (the target slide) rather than Stimulus1 (the prime slide). This was done because the participant cannot make a lexical decision before the target is shown, and taking responses from Stimulus1 would mean that the time spent waiting for the target to appear is factored into the response time.

This experiment template was built by Dylan Scott Low with support from the Department of English Language, Literature and Linguistics at Providence University, Taiwan.
