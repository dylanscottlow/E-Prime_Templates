# E-Prime_Templates: Lexical Priming
This is an experiment template based on an experiment designed by Justin F. Gerle, a Carnegie Mellon University student whose work was released as a student submission under STEP (System for Teaching Experimental Psychology). Gerle's original design can be downloaded from the official PST website at https://support.pstnet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047800273-STEP-Bi-directional-Priming-34544-, where it is hosted with the permission of Brian MacWhinney.

The current experiment was created as a refinement of Gerle's design.
